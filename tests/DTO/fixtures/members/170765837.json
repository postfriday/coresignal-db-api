He made valuable contributions and interesting comments, adding to a very lively class atmosphere.  Winston is also very good at multitasking and helping others.  When Winston has knowledge that others do not, he is happy to share.  He has a very creative mind, a keen eye for design and very good drawing skills.  His werewolf drawings and paintings for the monster class included the major topics/themes of the course: monsters, self and the hideous other using the stages of man morphing into werewolf.  His cross-disciplinary skills with art are fantastic.<br><br>Winston’s also has a full and lush style to his art, using rich colors and ripe imagery.

I am a professional in the Graphic Design industry and an instructor for the Westwood College Graphic Design Department.<br>The extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Harrell has been through his class with me in Multimedia Presentations with Flash (GD251) and Digital Layout (GD131). During that time Mr. Harrell exemplified a great level of creativity in his conceptualization of design projects. I am in touch with Mr. Harrell on an on-going basis and was able to witness his progress throughout his stay at Westwood. His ideas are grand and colorful and anyone can run with his original visual creations and end with a fabulous result.<br>Mr. Harrell has great vision, determination and patience as it relates to completing tasks. He is confident in his ability to grasp use of tools and software available to execute a design yet humble enough to ask for advice and assistance. He has also proven to be highly professional and helpful in his critique and cooperation with fellow learners. His professional attitude toward learning and the design industry is a level above many of his colleagues and he can be depended on to follow through. These qualities suite him well and are fitting for a creative leader/director as well as a team member in a creative support environment.<br>Should you have further inquiry, don’t hesitate to contact me.<br><br>Regards,<br><br>Tanacha Brown, M.S.<br>designertee@ymail.com</p>",

I am a professional in the Graphic Design industry and an instructor for the Westwood College Graphic Design Department.The extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Harrell has been through his class with me in Multimedia Presentations with Flash (GD251) and Digital Layout (GD131). During that time Mr. Harrell exemplified a great level of creativity in his conceptualization of design projects. I am in touch with Mr. Harrell on an on-going basis and was able to witness his progress throughout his stay at Westwood. His ideas are grand and colorful and anyone can run with his original visual creations and end with a fabulous result.Mr. Harrell has great vision, determination and patience as it relates to completing tasks. He is confident in his ability to grasp use of tools and software available to execute a design yet humble enough to ask for advice and assistance. He has also proven to be highly professional and helpful in his critique and cooperation with fellow learners. His professional attitude toward learning and the design industry is a level above many of his colleagues and he can be depended on to follow through. These qualities suite him well and are fitting for a creative leader/director as well as a team member in a creative support environment.Should you have further inquiry, don’t hesitate to contact me.Regards,Tanacha Brown, M.S.designertee@ymail.com",

I am a professional in the Graphic Design industry and an instructor for the Westwood College Graphic Design Department.\nThe extent of my acquaintance with Mr. Harrell has been through his class with me in Multimedia Presentations with Flash (GD251) and Digital Layout (GD131). During that time Mr. Harrell exemplified a great level of creativity in his conceptualization of design projects. I am in touch with Mr. Harrell on an on-going basis and was able to witness his progress throughout his stay at Westwood. His ideas are grand and colorful and anyone can run with his original visual creations and end with a fabulous result.\nMr. Harrell has great vision, determination and patience as it relates to completing tasks. He is confident in his ability to grasp use of tools and software available to execute a design yet humble enough to ask for advice and assistance. He has also proven to be highly professional and helpful in his critique and cooperation with fellow learners. His professional attitude toward learning and the design industry is a level above many of his colleagues and he can be depended on to follow through. These qualities suite him well and are fitting for a creative leader/director as well as a team member in a creative support environment.\nShould you have further inquiry, don’t hesitate to contact me.\n\nRegards,\n\nTanacha Brown, M.S.\ndesignertee@ymail.com",
