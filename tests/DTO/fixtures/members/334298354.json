EMOTO'S WATER EXPERIMENTS<br>♦ In Dr. Emoto's important studies he secured water samples from around the world. He placed the samples in bottles and subjected the water samples to positive words, visuals and music. When these samples were frozen and then thawed, Dr. Emoto's scientist took photos and these samples and the photos showed beautiful hexagonal images. He also subjected bottles of water from the same sources to negative words, visuals and music. These samples were also frozen and as they thawed photos were also taken of these images and these images were ugly, dark, unsightly blobs.<br><br>ANNE'S RICE EXPERIMENT<br>♦ I was encouraged to conduct my own test, with cooked rice which proved “proof positive” and was the inspiration for Lovitude. The experiment started on April 15, 2005 through May 15, 2005. I took four cups of cooked rice and put two cups in one plastic covered container where I wrote Love, Thank You, Lovitude® and the symbol on the container.<br><br>EXPERIMENT RESULTS<br>♦ I took the other two cups of cooked rice and put them into another plastic container.<br>For 30 days I greeted the rice with the positive words and energy each day. I \"dissed\", the other rice. See the photo below.</p>",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .<br>Bring: computers<br>Check settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).<br>Prepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).<br>Take turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.<br>Search: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.<br>Make meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:<br>\"Hi Nate,<br><br>I would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.<br><br>Please let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.<br><br>Be well, my thoughtful friend,<br>Anne<br><br>Nate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com<br>Max Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"<br><br>TIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.</p>",

            "description": "Here's how a Meaningful Connections LinkedIn Party works: Invite: 3 to 5 people who have different but complimentary networks to a 'LinkedIn Party'. Meet up: at a location with internet access for instance a coffee shop community room, local community center, library room, virtual office location, the outplacement companies meeting room. In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms . Bring: computers Check settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone). Prepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience). Take turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people. Search: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search. Make meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as: \"Hi Nate, I would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you. Please let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen. Be well, my thoughtful friend, Anne Nate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com Max Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\" TIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .<br>Bring: computers<br>Check settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).<br>Prepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).<br>Take turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.<br>Search: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.<br>Make meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:<br>\"Hi Nate,<br><br>I would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.<br><br>Please let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.<br><br>Be well, my thoughtful friend,<br>Anne<br><br>Nate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com<br>Max Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"<br><br>TIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.</p>",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .<br>Bring: computers<br>Check settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).<br>Prepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).<br>Take turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.<br>Search: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.<br>Make meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:<br>\"Hi Nate,<br><br>I would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.<br><br>Please let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.<br><br>Be well, my thoughtful friend,<br>Anne<br><br>Nate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com<br>Max Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"<br><br>TIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.</p>",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .<br>Bring: computers<br>Check settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).<br>Prepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).<br>Take turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.<br>Search: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.<br>Make meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:<br>\"Hi Nate,<br><br>I would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.<br><br>Please let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.<br><br>Be well, my thoughtful friend,<br>Anne<br><br>Nate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com<br>Max Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"<br><br>TIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.</p>",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .<br>Bring: computers<br>Check settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).<br>Prepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).<br>Take turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.<br>Search: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.<br>Make meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:<br>\"Hi Nate,<br><br>I would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.<br><br>Please let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.<br><br>Be well, my thoughtful friend,<br>Anne<br><br>Nate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com<br>Max Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"<br><br>TIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.</p>",

Discover how a new understanding of consciousness enhances total well-being—physical, emotional, spiritual, social, communal, financial, and ecological.\nThroughout the weekend, Deepak Chopra guides us in exploring these and other important questions:\nIs there the possibility of an ultimate reality?\nDoes consciousness conceive, govern, construct, and become the physical universe?\nDo we have the ability to influence the future evolution of the cosmos?\nIs the universe becoming self-aware in the human nervous system?\nWill the next stage of human development be a conscious evolution?\nWe also learn about practical ways to enhance creativity, intuition, and conscious choice-making; awaken dormant potentials such as nonlocal communication and nonlocal sensory experience; and experience higher consciousness, transformation, and healing.\n- See more at: http://www.eomega.org/workshops/the-future-of-well-being#-workshop-description-block",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .\nBring: computers\nCheck settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).\nPrepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).\nTake turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.\nSearch: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.\nMake meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:\n\"Hi Nate,\nI would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.\nPlease let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.\nBe well, my thoughtful friend,\nAnne\nNate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com\nMax Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"\nTIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.",

Discover how a new understanding of consciousness enhances total well-being—physical, emotional, spiritual, social, communal, financial, and ecological.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Deepak Chopra guides us in exploring these and other important questions:\n\nIs there the possibility of an ultimate reality?\nDoes consciousness conceive, govern, construct, and become the physical universe?\nDo we have the ability to influence the future evolution of the cosmos?\nIs the universe becoming self-aware in the human nervous system?\nWill the next stage of human development be a conscious evolution?\nWe also learn about practical ways to enhance creativity, intuition, and conscious choice-making; awaken dormant potentials such as nonlocal communication and nonlocal sensory experience; and experience higher consciousness, transformation, and healing.\n\n- See more at: http://www.eomega.org/workshops/the-future-of-well-being#-workshop-description-block",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .\nBring: computers\nCheck settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).\nPrepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).\nTake turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.\nSearch: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.\nMake meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:\n\"Hi Nate,\n\nI would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.\n\nPlease let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.\n\nBe well, my thoughtful friend,\nAnne\n\nNate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com\nMax Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"\n\nTIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.",

Discover how a new understanding of consciousness enhances total well-being—physical, emotional, spiritual, social, communal, financial, and ecological.\n\nThroughout the weekend, Deepak Chopra guides us in exploring these and other important questions:\n\nIs there the possibility of an ultimate reality?\nDoes consciousness conceive, govern, construct, and become the physical universe?\nDo we have the ability to influence the future evolution of the cosmos?\nIs the universe becoming self-aware in the human nervous system?\nWill the next stage of human development be a conscious evolution?\nWe also learn about practical ways to enhance creativity, intuition, and conscious choice-making; awaken dormant potentials such as nonlocal communication and nonlocal sensory experience; and experience higher consciousness, transformation, and healing.\n\n- See more at: http://www.eomega.org/workshops/the-future-of-well-being#-workshop-description-block",

In Minneapolis / St. some of our grocery stores have free community rooms .\nBring: computers\nCheck settings: everyone has their connections open (check the Settings to open connections to Everyone).\nPrepare: a list of 10 people that they'd like to meet: titles, industries, companies, specialties, location, size of company, (their target audience).\nTake turns: each person gets 10 minutes to ask the other members to search for his / her targeted people.\nSearch: friends all go to the \"Advanced\" area located next to the white Search box at the top of the profile page and type in the targeted keywords, titles, industries, companies, locations, etc. and click search.\nMake meaningful connection: when the member finds a good connection they send a message, inside of LinkedIn, they include the friend and create a message such as:\n\"Hi Nate,\n\nI would like to introduce you to my friend Max. He's on my softball team and he is a seasoned product manager who is interested in your advice and expertise around medical device manufacturing as he is seeking to transition from Company X. I am including him on this message and will invite him to reach out to you.\n\nPlease let me know what I can be on the look-out for you. I know that when good people meet good things happen.\n\nBe well, my thoughtful friend,\nAnne\n\nNate Nelson: nate.nelson@me.com\nMax Smith: maxsmith2@gmail.com\"\n\nTIP: I always include the email addresses for each person in the introduction email.",

            "description": "<p class=\"description\">1. Headline. Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.</p>",

Add these  in the Specialties, Skills and Interests sections.<br>3)\tBuild a Company page – create a free company page on LinkedIn.  Go to Company, Add Page.  Add key words in Specialties. <br>4)\tGet Recommendations – this is especially important for business development. (90% of my business comes from LinkedIn referrals.) Get them on your Profile and Company pages.<br>5)\tUse the Applications – upload your company PPT presentation with Slideshare.  It's located under the MORE tab.<br>6)\tStart using Advanced Search.<br>7)\tLeverage the Companies tab to find prospects – do you have a list of target companies. See People, Departures, New Hires, Skills, revenues, growth, and news.<br>8)\tInvite the right Connections – connect with influencers and relevant contacts that you can help and that can help you.  <br>9)\tJoin Groups – the action in happening in Groups.  Type in the Group categories that you’re interested in, like CPA referrals or Franchisees.  Join the Groups; watch the Discussions, then start a Discussion.  This is where the business development is really happening.<br>10)\tStart your marketing – using the Status Bar, ‘what are you working on’, sharing relevant tips that your connections would be interested in.  My three strategies are: 1) Humble self-promotions, 2) Promotion of others and 3) information or education content.  This information can be connected with your Twitter account, so keep the character count to 140 characters or less, about 15 words.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"description\">1. Headline. Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"description\">1. Headline. Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.</p>",

Add these  in the Specialties, Skills and Interests sections.<br>3)\tBuild a Company page – create a free company page on LinkedIn.  Go to Company, Add Page.  Add key words in Specialties. <br>4)\tGet Recommendations – this is especially important for business development. (90% of my business comes from LinkedIn referrals.) Get them on your Profile and Company pages.<br>5)\tUse the Applications – upload your company PPT presentation with Slideshare.  It's located under the MORE tab.<br>6)\tStart using Advanced Search.<br>7)\tLeverage the Companies tab to find prospects – do you have a list of target companies. See People, Departures, New Hires, Skills, revenues, growth, and news.<br>8)\tInvite the right Connections – connect with influencers and relevant contacts that you can help and that can help you.  <br>9)\tJoin Groups – the action in happening in Groups.  Type in the Group categories that you’re interested in, like CPA referrals or Franchisees.  Join the Groups; watch the Discussions, then start a Discussion.  This is where the business development is really happening.<br>10)\tStart your marketing – using the Status Bar, ‘what are you working on’, sharing relevant tips that your connections would be interested in.  My three strategies are: 1) Humble self-promotions, 2) Promotion of others and 3) information or education content.  This information can be connected with your Twitter account, so keep the character count to 140 characters or less, about 15 words.</p>",

Where do you want to go?” LinkedIn expert Anne Pryor recommends asking yourself questions like these as you compose your profile on the site. With 500 million users, LinkedIn is a place where you can see job openings and employers can find you. Here are more tips from Pryor.<br><br>• While you’re tinkering with the wording of your profile, go to the privacy settings. Under “sharing profile edits,” click “no,” so your connections aren’t blasted with notifications every time you tweak a few words.<br><br>• Compose your profile using keywords that optimize your chances of coming up in recruiters’ searches. Keywords echo wording in descriptions of jobs that match your skills. The most key of the keywords should go closest to the top.</p>",

With all things digital changing your delegates’ preferences and expectations by the near nano-second, we have compiled an overview of this relatively new breed of traveler, researching their go-to websites and apps that they commonly use now and will undoubtedly use in the future, both in their personal and professional lives. Like you, we believe it is critical to understand these trends, fleeting or lasting as they may be, to provide the best experience possible for visitors to our city today and in the future.

            "description": "<p class=\"description\">1. Headline. Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.</p>",

Add these  in the Specialties, Skills and Interests sections.<br>3)\tBuild a Company page – create a free company page on LinkedIn.  Go to Company, Add Page.  Add key words in Specialties. <br>4)\tGet Recommendations – this is especially important for business development. (90% of my business comes from LinkedIn referrals.) Get them on your Profile and Company pages.<br>5)\tUse the Applications – upload your company PPT presentation with Slideshare.  It's located under the MORE tab.<br>6)\tStart using Advanced Search.<br>7)\tLeverage the Companies tab to find prospects – do you have a list of target companies. See People, Departures, New Hires, Skills, revenues, growth, and news.<br>8)\tInvite the right Connections – connect with influencers and relevant contacts that you can help and that can help you.  <br>9)\tJoin Groups – the action in happening in Groups.

My three strategies are: 1) Humble self-promotions, 2) Promotion of others and 3) information or education content.  This information can be connected with your Twitter account, so keep the character count to 140 characters or less, about 15 words.</p>",

Where do you want to go?” LinkedIn expert Anne Pryor recommends asking yourself questions like these as you compose your profile on the site. With 500 million users, LinkedIn is a place where you can see job openings and employers can find you. Here are more tips from Pryor.<br><br>• While you’re tinkering with the wording of your profile, go to the privacy settings. Under “sharing profile edits,” click “no,” so your connections aren’t blasted with notifications every time you tweak a few words.<br><br>• Compose your profile using keywords that optimize your chances of coming up in recruiters’ searches. Keywords echo wording in descriptions of jobs that match your skills. The most key of the keywords should go closest to the top.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"description\">1. Headline. Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.</p>",

It's located under the MORE tab.<br>6)\tStart using Advanced Search.<br>7)\tLeverage the Companies tab to find prospects – do you have a list of target companies. See People, Departures, New Hires, Skills, revenues, growth, and news.<br>8)\tInvite the right Connections – connect with influencers and relevant contacts that you can help and that can help you.  <br>9)\tJoin Groups – the action in happening in Groups.

Where do you want to go?” LinkedIn expert Anne Pryor recommends asking yourself questions like these as you compose your profile on the site. With 500 million users, LinkedIn is a place where you can see job openings and employers can find you. Here are more tips from Pryor.<br><br>• While you’re tinkering with the wording of your profile, go to the privacy settings. Under “sharing profile edits,” click “no,” so your connections aren’t blasted with notifications every time you tweak a few words.<br><br>• Compose your profile using keywords that optimize your chances of coming up in recruiters’ searches. Keywords echo wording in descriptions of jobs that match your skills. The most key of the keywords should go closest to the top.\n        </p>",

Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.\n        </p>",

Though Anne was not an artist and nor was Irene, the directions are specific that she is to breathe the souls of those who have passed into her paintings using this unusual technique. Within months, Anne has created hundreds of paintings. These astonishing showpieces, some of which are included in the book, are awakening others around the world to connect with the spirit world themselves.",

Where do you want to go?” LinkedIn expert Anne Pryor recommends asking yourself questions like these as you compose your profile on the site. With 500 million users, LinkedIn is a place where you can see job openings and employers can find you. Here are more tips from Pryor.\n\n• While you’re tinkering with the wording of your profile, go to the privacy settings. Under “sharing profile edits,” click “no,” so your connections aren’t blasted with notifications every time you tweak a few words.\n\n• Compose your profile using keywords that optimize your chances of coming up in recruiters’ searches. Keywords echo wording in descriptions of jobs that match your skills. The most key of the keywords should go closest to the top.",

Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.",

Add these  in the Specialties, Skills and Interests sections.\n3)\tBuild a Company page – create a free company page on LinkedIn.  Go to Company, Add Page.  Add key words in Specialties.\n4)\tGet Recommendations – this is especially important for business development. (90% of my business comes from LinkedIn referrals.) Get them on your Profile and Company pages.\n5)\tUse the Applications – upload your company PPT presentation with Slideshare.  It's located under the MORE tab.\n6)\tStart using Advanced Search.\n7)\tLeverage the Companies tab to find prospects – do you have a list of target companies. See People, Departures, New Hires, Skills, revenues, growth, and news.\n8)\tInvite the right Connections – connect with influencers and relevant contacts that you can help and that can help you.\n9)\tJoin Groups – the action in happening in Groups.

My three strategies are: 1) Humble self-promotions, 2) Promotion of others and 3) information or education content.  This information can be connected with your Twitter account, so keep the character count to 140 characters or less, about 15 words.",

Immediately following Irene's death, Risë begins to sense her friend's presence around her. While delivering her eulogy from the pulpit at Irene's Celebration of Life, Risë sees Irene sitting in the congregation, her long auburn hair reflecting light from the windows above. Irene is calm and joyful as she glances, smiling, over her family and friends.\n\nA fascinating year unfolds as Risë receives continuous communication from Irene from the afterlife through lucid dreams, channeled messages, and synchronicities too profound to be manifestations of her imagination. Under the weekly guidance of a spiritual leadership coach, Risë commits to a disciplined practice of daily meditation, guided imagery, spiritual experiences, and journaling to document all that she is experiencing and to make sense of this new relationship with the afterlife.\n\nOne year later, Irene directs Risë to write this book from the journals she has filled, telling her that she will be her ghost writer from the other side. The book is to be shared with the world, offering hope and understanding that our loved ones are always with us from beyond the veil to bring comfort and support.\n\nWeeks later, the third friend, Anne, receives instructions from Irene to begin creating large, inspiring, \"peacock-colored\" paintings, using special inks and her breath. Though Anne was not an artist and nor was Irene, the directions are specific that she is to breathe the souls of those who have passed into her paintings using this unusual technique. Within months, Anne has created hundreds of paintings. These astonishing showpieces, some of which are included in the book, are awakening others around the world to connect with the spirit world themselves.",

Where do you want to go?” LinkedIn expert Anne Pryor recommends asking yourself questions like these as you compose your profile on the site. With 500 million users, LinkedIn is a place where you can see job openings and employers can find you. Here are more tips from Pryor.\n\n• While you’re tinkering with the wording of your profile, go to the privacy settings. Under “sharing profile edits,” click “no,” so your connections aren’t blasted with notifications every time you tweak a few words.\n\n• Compose your profile using keywords that optimize your chances of coming up in recruiters’ searches. Keywords echo wording in descriptions of jobs that match your skills. The most key of the keywords should go closest to the top.",

            "description": "1. Headline. Your headline has the same function as the headline of an advertisement; its primary purpose is to get the target audience to want to read on. Yet most LinkedIn members think “headline = job title.” If you don’t write a headline, LinkedIn uses your current job title as a default, and that’s a real snooze.  To have your headline work for you, it should say what you do and entice people to learn more about your services. Don’t make it all about you; make it about the people you serve. Tell viewers what you can do for them. The second crucial function of the headline is to serve as an online “magnet.” If you want to be found in a search, you have to pack your headline with the keywords for which you want to be known. Making this an even greater challenge, you need to accomplish all that in just 120 characters. Here are some excellent examples of headlines from LinkedIn trainer and coach Anne Pryor.",

Add these  in the Specialties, Skills and Interests sections.\n3)\tBuild a Company page – create a free company page on LinkedIn.  Go to Company, Add Page.  Add key words in Specialties.\n4)\tGet Recommendations – this is especially important for business development. (90% of my business comes from LinkedIn referrals.) Get them on your Profile and Company pages.\n5)\tUse the Applications – upload your company PPT presentation with Slideshare.  It's located under the MORE tab.\n6)\tStart using Advanced Search.\n7)\tLeverage the Companies tab to find prospects – do you have a list of target companies. See People, Departures, New Hires, Skills, revenues, growth, and news.\n8)\tInvite the right Connections – connect with influencers and relevant contacts that you can help and that can help you.\n9)\tJoin Groups – the action in happening in Groups.

My three strategies are: 1) Humble self-promotions, 2) Promotion of others and 3) information or education content.

By establishing strong connections with those she meets, she's able to better support her coaching clients.
