It was a day to be proud, but rather I felt humbled by the way the Lord uses our talents for a greater cause.\n\nSecond-place winner is Lea Panajon, whose masterpiece was also a product of digital art. It depicts a bull that represents love, peace, and prosperity in the midst of the hustle and bustle of modern life. She won P50,000 and the Swatch Special “Bulls on Parade.” Third-place winner is Kristoffer Tolentino for his sculpture of a bull created from recycled materials, from plastic bottles and nails to trumpos and tahong. He took home P30,000 and the Swatch Special “Bulls on Parade.” Fourth place is Rolindo Beldia III for his modern interpretation and textured painting of a bull. He won P20,000 and the Special Swatch.",
